### Most of you are data scientists!

### Every analysis is new and different

- More data
- New statistics
- Science getting more complex

---

## What quantitative skills do you want to improve?

- Statistics: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">
inference, tests </span>
- Maths: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">calculus, probability, linear algebra</span>
- Computer science: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">numerical approximations, software development, High-performance computing</span>
- Coding: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">data wrangling, visualisation, scripting, reproducible research</span>

<span style="font-size:0.6em; color:#e49436"> (everyone pick at least one & share) </span>

## Strategies to improve (coding)

---

### When are good times to learn new skills?

<span style="font-size:0.6em; color:#e49436"> (discuss) </span>

---

### 1. Each project is a learning opportunity

- focus on what you need
- spend time to learn it
- often takes time but builds capacity
- refer back at later date


---

### 2. Practice reproducible research

- All steps of analysis scripted (R, Python, Matlab)
- Documents your skills/learning
- Invaluable for "future self"
- Pathway to collaboration

---

### 3. Raise awareness of unknowns

- R user groups: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray"> [Environmental computing](http://environmentalcomputing.net/calendar/) </span>
- Blog posts: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray"> (via twitter, google) </span>
- Courses:<span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray"> [stats central](http://www.analytical.unsw.edu.au/facilities/stats-central-2), [software carpentry](software-carpentry.org), </span>
- Online courses: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">[datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)</span>
- Meetups: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">[Sydney Users of R forum](https://www.meetup.com/R-Users-Sydney) </span>
- Conferences: <span style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray"> [UseR 2018](https://www.r-project.org/conferences.html) </span>

---

### Environmental computing

- Fridays 2-3pm, E26 teaching lab 5
- R focussed
- Topics: Project management, data wrangling, plotting, stats, maps, ...
- [http://environmentalcomputing.net/calendar/](http://environmentalcomputing.net/calendar/)

### 4. Dive in deep

![Deep work](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41k-9d0WZyL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

---

### Two types of deep work

1. In the flow (feels good)
2. Pushing yourself (it hurts a bit)


---

### 5. Learn to problem solve

---

### These strategies make better code

1. [Rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)
2. [A second set of eyes (code review)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)
3. [Minimal working example (MWE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example)
4. [Abstraction / writing functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction)
5. [Testing code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
6. [Refactoring (a big re-write)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)

---

### 6. Master concepts more than technologies

Example: Machine learning vs traditional statistics

---

### 7. Teach

* Novice:  <span style="color:grey">Is blissfully unaware  </span>
* Intermediate / competent user:  <span style="color:grey"> Is aware of their limits </span>
* Expert: <span style="color:grey"> Mastered technology but becomes blind </span>

## Conclusion

1. No quick fixes - requires sustained effort
2. Life-long learning
3. Keep it real / achievable
